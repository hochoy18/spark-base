## Security
Security in Spark is OFF by default. This could mean you are vulnerable to attack by default.  Please see [Spark Security](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/security.html) before downloading and running Spark.


## Downloading
Get Spark from the [downloads page](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) of the project website.

## Running the Examples and Shell


## Launching on a Cluster
The Spark cluster mode overview explains the key concepts in running on a cluster. Spark can run both by itself, or over several existing cluster managers. It currently provides several options for deployment:
- [**Standalone Deploy Mode**](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html): simplest way to deploy Spark on a private cluster
- [**Apache Mesos**](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-mesos.html)
- [**Hadoop YARN**](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-yarn.html)
- [**Kubernetes**](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-kubernetes.html)
