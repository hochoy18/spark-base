Obviously, we have to acknowledge that showing the respect to others has the potential to change an
individual’s surrounding atmosphere and thus change his whole life.

　　There are numerous details related to the significance of respecting others,
with the following three being the most remarkable. Firstly, respecting people around you is
one of our traditional brilliant cultures that ought to be inherited and maintained forever.
Actually, it is a good way for us to spread our custom to the world through our daily behavior,
for example, respecting the foreign students when we study together. Secondly, this valuable quality
is not only a symbol of your politeness but also a useful way to build relationships.
To be honest, no one wants to make friends with those who are contemptuous.
Thirdly, as long as you respect others, they would in return take the same attitude to you
and even appreciate you, which has the ability to place you in a beneficial position in the future.

　　To sum up, the spirit of esteeming others is playing an increasingly important role in our life.
